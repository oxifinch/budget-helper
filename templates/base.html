{{define "base"}}
<!-- 
    "base" wants to render two things:
    1. "head"
    2. "body"

    Depending on which file is passed with this template,
    "head" and "body" are different things. For example,
    if tmplHome is used, "head" and "body" is defined
    in /templates/pages/home.html. 

    But nothing is being sent except a bunch of blank lines. Why?
    (Try sending output to os.Stdout instead of w to see what I mean)
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>{{template "head" .}}</head>
    <body>{{template "body" .}}</body>
</html>
{{end}}
